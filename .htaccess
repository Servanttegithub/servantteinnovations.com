# If you have specific directories or files you want to protect, you can add rules here
# For example, to allow access to a specific file:
# RewriteRule ^secret-file.txt$ - [L]

# If you have no restrictions, the following line will allow all traffic:
Order allow,deny
Allow from all

# To prevent directory listings
Options -Indexes

# Optional: Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
# RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]
